        <h1> About Me </h1> 
        <p> My name is Bryce Vanderlaan. I am a 22 year old Computer Science student at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
        After completing a degree in History last spring, I decided to pivot towards a career path better suited to my interests and temperment. <br>
        I am very excited to embark on the journey of learning to code and feel that a career in software development will fit me well. <br>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy surfing, gaming, and working out. Gaming has been a life long passion of mine, beginning at the age of 5, <br>
        and it was this that sparked my interest in computers. In fact, making some kind of game is a life goal for me. <br>
        Thanks for taking the time to read more about me! </p>
